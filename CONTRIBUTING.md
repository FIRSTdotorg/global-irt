# How to contribute?

Building Global IRT **requires consensus**. 
Consensus is not always easy to achieve and it will always require discussions.

We will use github as a tool to
  * have discussions (via issues)
  * track change requests
  * track changes
  * support versioning of the Global IRT project and the common taxonomy of CSIRT

Having emphasised the consensus, please follow these guidelines for contributing:

  1. first use github's issue tracker to propose changes
  2. propose a change via github's pull request mechanism
  3. accept possibly some more discussions (and don't give up)
  4. these changes will go through eventually
  5. a new version of the Global IRT standard will be tagged in github as such,
  6. old versions will be archived and marked as old.
